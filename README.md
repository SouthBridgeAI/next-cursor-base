## Introduction

This repository is designed as a foundation for building sophisticated applications with AI integration. It leverages the power of Next.js along with a comprehensive suite of UI components, making it easy to prototype and integrate AI-driven features like natural language processing, chatbots, data analytics, and recommendation engines.

## Features

- **Next.js Setup:** A modern framework engineered for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Bun-Ready Environment:** Optimized for Bun, providing a super-fast bundler, runtime, and package manager.
- **Pre-Built UI Components:** An extensive library of UI components (forms, cards, alerts, charts, etc.) located in the `src/components/ui` folder.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Utility-first styling with full theme support and easy-to-customize configurations.
- **Component Examples:** The `/examples` folder contains a variety of examples—from charts to login forms and sidebars—that can be pulled into your project to build more complex solutions.
- **AI-Ready Infrastructure:** Easily extendible to integrate your preferred AI services or custom models.
- **TypeScript Support:** Full type safety for modern JavaScript development.
- **Scalable & Modular:** A solid project structure that is designed to grow as your application and AI integrations evolve.

## Project Structure

```

├── package.json         # Project dependencies and scripts
├── README.md            # Documentation and usage instructions
├── src/
│   ├── app/             # Application entry points (layout, pages, global styling)
│   ├── components/      # Reusable UI components (e.g., accordion, alert, button, chart, etc.)
│   └── lib/             # Utility functions and helper modules (e.g., AI services)
└── examples/            # Example components and pages demonstrating advanced integrations
```

- **`package.json`:** Contains project scripts and dependencies. This repository is configured with Next.js alongside support for AI-friendly development.
- **`src/app`:** Houses your main application layouts, routing, and global styles.
- **`src/components/ui`:** Contains commonly used UI components for rapid development.
- **`examples`:** Provides sample code to demonstrate component usage. These examples can be pulled into your project context to build more complex features with robust AI integrations.

## Development Workflow

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/next-cursor-base.git
   cd next-cursor-base
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies with Bun**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your app.

4. **Develop & Test Components**

   - Use the examples in the `examples` folder as a reference to understand how components work.
   - Create new UI components or extend existing ones in the `src/components/ui` directory.
   - Utilize Tailwind CSS classes for rapid styling and customization.

5. **Version Control & Collaboration**
   - Use Git for version control and follow a feature branching workflow.
   - Submit pull requests for code reviews and collaborative development.

## AI Integration Workflow

Integrating AI into your application is made simple with this base:

1. **Define Your AI Use Case:**
   Identify where AI can enhance your application—be it for chatbots, recommendation systems, data visualization, or more.

2. **Install AI Libraries/SDKs via Bun:**
   For example, to integrate with the OpenAI API:

   ```bash
   bun add openai
   ```

3. **Set Up AI Services:**
   Create new service files (e.g., `src/lib/ai.ts`) that encapsulate API calls and configure any necessary API keys or environment variables.

4. **Create AI-Enabled Components:**
   Develop new components (or extend existing ones) that leverage your AI services. Examples might include an intelligent chatbot or dynamic analytics dashboard.

5. **Manage State & Context:**
   Use React Context along with custom hooks to efficiently manage AI-related state across your application.

6. **Iterate and Test:**
   Continuously test your AI integrations in development and refine the user experience.

## Running the Project

- **Development:**

  ```bash
  bun run dev
